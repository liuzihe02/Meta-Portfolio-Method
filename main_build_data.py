# '''PART 0: CREATING LIST OF TICKER UNIVERSES
# Uncomment this section should you wish to create your own universes
# In the UCL paper, a list of 10 universes was created from a pool of 18 assets,
# each universe sharing at most 2 assets. Under these constraints, such a list was created.

# This section creates the list of universes and is stored as univs.pkl. If user wants to load
# the univs.pkl file provided, this section can be removed.

# Aggregate Bonds: AGG 
# Emerging Markets: VWO, EEM
# Developed Markets: VEA, EFA
# Japanese Equities: EWJ
# Gold: GLD, IAU
# NASDAQ-100 index: QQQ
# 1-3year T-bonds: SHY
# S&P500: SPY
# Index-Linked Bonds: TIP
# Real Estate: VNQ

#only after cov_period will weights be calculated, so index_ also accounts for this
cov_period=252 #n.o. of days in one trading year
