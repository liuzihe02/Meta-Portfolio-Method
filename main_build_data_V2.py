# '''PART 0: CREATING LIST OF TICKER UNIVERSES
# In the UCL paper, a list of 10 universes was created from a pool of 18 assets,
# each universe sharing at most 2 assets. Under these constraints, such a list was created.

# Aggregate Bonds: AGG 
# Emerging Markets: VWO, EEM
# Developed Markets: VEA, EFA
# Japanese Equities: EWJ
# Gold: GLD, IAU
# NASDAQ-100 index: QQQ
# 1-3year T-bonds: SHY
# S&P500: SPY
# Index-Linked Bonds: TIP
# Real Estate: VNQ
# Healthcare: XLV
# Value Equities: IWD
# Small cap Equities: IWM
# Corporate Bonds: LQD
# 20year+ T-bonds: TLT
# Mid-cap Equities: VO
# Small-cap value: VBR
# Consumer services: XLY'''
